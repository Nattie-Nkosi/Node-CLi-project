# Node CLI command project _node-ls_

A clone of "ls command" in Linux, Mac and Windows based system CMD to list files. I created my own `ls` command :).

- Enter `node-ls`.
- The command entered will list all files in current folder.
- Can enter arguments after the command eg `node-ls ~/` or `node-ls ~/pathname`.

### Tech Stack
